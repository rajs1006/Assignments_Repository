Of those, the one that could learn from the data, and that also offered enough complexity to produce an accurate decision function was k-nearest neighbors. However, nearest neighbors can be slow when implemented in pure Python (i.e. with loops). This is especially the case when the number of data points or input dimensions is large.\n",

In particular, performance graphs will be drawn using the library `matplotlib`.\n",

The variable `d` denotes the number of dimensions of each point. The toy dataset is pseudo-random, that is, for fixed parameters, it produce a random-looking dataset, but every time the method is called with the same parameters, the dataset is the same.

We consider a small handwritten digits recognition dataset, that can be directly obtained from the library `scikit-learn`. This dataset consists of handwritten digits of size `8 x 8` flattened into arrays of size `64`, with class between `0` and `9`. We use a function `data.digits()` to load the data and arrange data points in some predefined order."
